          <h1>My Giant List of Self Test Questions</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my Giant List of Ruby Questions.&#160; My workflow has been to read the books listed below creating questions based on what I felt was important material.&#160;</p>
        <p>Questions are totally relevant for the latest and greatest Ruby versions. There are a handful of questions that ask about how older versions of Ruby behave differently.</p>
        <p>This list of questions is certainly not for everyone, do with it what you want. Some of it may not make sense as all questions and answers were created for me personally to read and review. Hopefully nothing in there is wrong, but PLEASE let me know if there is an error!</p>
        <p>Follow me on Twitter <a href="http://Twitter.com/ShawnLindsey" title="http://Twitter.com/ShawnLindsey" target="_blank">@ShawnLindsey</a> and follow my personal project <a href="http://CappedIn.com" title="http://CappedIn.com">CappedIn.com</a> and its Twitter feed <a href="http://Twitter.com/CappedIn_Feed" title="http://Twitter.com/CappedIn_Feed">@CappedIn_Feed</a>
        </p>
        <h2>I read each of these books in this order, creating questions along the way.</h2>

        <h2>And here are the questions. Answers follow. </h2>
        <p>I kept the questions in one file and the answers in another and would just toggle between them.</p>
